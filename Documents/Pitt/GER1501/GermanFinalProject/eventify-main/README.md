## Introduction

Eventify is a cutting-edge hybrid Next.js + Python application that redefines event management. Leveraging the seamless integration of Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the API backend, Eventify enables users to capture, upload, and manage event details like never before. Whether it's snapping a picture of an event pamphlet or recording a voice message, Eventify transforms your input into actionable calendar events.

## How It Works

Eventify automatically generates calendar events from various types of input. Whether you upload a photo of a flyer, paste a copied discord message, or snap a picture of an event on a whiteboard, the system will take the image and convert the text into a .ics file that can be imported into any calendar app. You can also speak to the system directly or type your input to request an event of any kind.

This is a tool designed to save you time by turning your screenshots, photos, and thoughts into structured calendar events instantly.

## Features

- **Capture and Upload:** Effortlessly upload images of events or pamphlets and transform your experience.
- **Voice Message Recording:** Record voice messages that convey event details, making it easy to capture everything without typing.
- **Calendar Integration:** Automatically add your uploaded images and recorded messages to your calendar, making event management a breeze.
